# admin-dashboard-css

## Description

This is a recreation of the holy grail layout in the theme of an admin dashboard built with CSS. Specifically this uses grid for the larger layout and flexbox to organize elements within the grid cells. The empty circles are representations of profile photos, and the icons are from font-awesome.
